# Scripting
- Scripting allows us to
    - automate frequently used commands
    - customize commands for different scenarios using arguments and variables
- think of scripts as documentation
    - if you find yourself listing commands used to perform a task, consider scripting instead
- often ends with .sh (short for shell)
